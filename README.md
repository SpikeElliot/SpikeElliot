# I'm Spike!
- üéì Third-year Computer Science Undergrad @ Goldsmiths, University of London

- üí≠ I'm interested in Software Engineering and have a passion for Machine Learning and Data Mining

- üéØ My skills include: Python, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, JavaScript, Node/Express, Java, OOP

- ü™õ I'm currently working on an electric guitar "rhythm game" that leverages pre-trained ML models for
guitar separation and pitch detection to help users learn to play their favourite songs

# Projects

## [üé∏ Guitaraoke](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Guitaraoke)

### Overview

A standalone Python application, this software implements open-source pre-trained Machine Learning models
and audio libraries to provide a gamified environment for electric guitarists to learn to play new songs.

### Features

- The user can select a local audio file to add to their library, initiating guitar separation
through use of the [6-stem HT Demucs MSS model](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs), followed by pitch
detection of the song's separated guitar track using [Spotify's Basic Pitch library](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch).

- A scoring algorithm compares the user input and guitar tracks' predicted note event information during playback
to determine a performance score and note accuracy rate that is updated and displayed in real-time.

- A practical and responsive GUI with aesthetic CSS styling was built using PyQt5, allowing the user to easily
navigate between the song library, practice mode, playthrough mode, and help menu.

- Separating processes through QThreads and the threading module allows the application to handle
sounddevice I/O audio streaming, real-time scoring in an audio recording and processing loop, and the GUI
concurrently with minimal latency and no blocking/freezing.

- The practice mode provides helpful audio playback controls such as: a guitar track volume slider,
a play/pause button, a custom-made interactable waveform that provides functionality for seeking and section
looping with user-set markers, etc.

## [üèÉ Fitter](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Fitter)

### Overview

A web development project that showcased full-stack development skills, producing a prototype for a 
fitness-themed social media platform with Strava API integration and functionality for posting activities,
following users, liking, commenting, and more.

### Features

- Integration with Strava API allows a user to connect their Fitter and Strava accounts through OAuth 2.0,
providing access to their recent activities. An activity can optionally be linked to a post, "embedding"
relevant exercise data in the post's body, allowing a user to share their performance with others.

- CSS styling creates an aesthetic, consistent, and intuitive user experience for the web app. A sidebar
provides easy navigation to important pages such as the user's profile, their likes, and the home page.
A sticky header displays a search bar and a dropdown menu relating to user functionality such as connecting
to Strava or logging out.

- SQL queries in the Express middleware call Stored Procedures that are performed internally by the database.
This gives: efficiency, as operations are faster; readability, as queries don‚Äôt need to be chained in the
middleware; better separation of concerns between the application and data tiers.

- Security and data integrity: All forms are validated and sanitised using express-validator to prevent
XSS attacks, all SQL queries are parameterised to avoid injection attacks, users' passwords are encrypted
and hash salted with bcrypt.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript ‚Ä¢ Node/Express ‚Ä¢ MySQL ‚Ä¢ HTML ‚Ä¢ CSS**

## [üéµ Karaoke and Rhythm Game](https://github.com/sahas036211/p5-Karaoke-and-Rhythm-Game)

### Overview

A proof of concept built using the p5.js library that features a keyboard-controlled
rhythm game, a karaoke game using microphone input, and a music player providing
audio playback controls and various visualisers to select from.

### Features

The rhythm game features procedural real-time note generation synchronised to the song's tempo,
an in-depth scoring system, difficulty options that adjust note spawn rates, and 3D graphics
rendering of game environment.

The music player showcases various visualisations, audio playback controls, a clickable progress
bar, and a webcam input integrated visualisation through use of p5's FFT functions.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript ‚Ä¢ p5.js**

## [üßë‚Äçüè´ Bookit: Room Booking Application](https://github.com/jbrun001/roombooking)

### Overview

A collaborative group project to develop a responsive room booking web application for a university.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript ‚Ä¢ Node/Express ‚Ä¢ MySQL ‚Ä¢ HTML ‚Ä¢ CSS**

## [üá≠ Hangman Game](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Java-Hangman-Game)

### Overview 

An endless hangman game with a simple score system designed as a small test application to demonstrate 
proficiency with Java Swing. 

### Technologies Used

**Java**
