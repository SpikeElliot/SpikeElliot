- 💭 I'm interested in Software Engineering and have a passion for Machine Learning and Data Mining

- 🎯 My skills include: Python, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, JavaScript, Node/Express, Java, OOP

- 🪛 I'm currently working on an electric guitar "rhythm game" that leverages pre-trained ML models for
guitar separation and pitch detection to help users learn to play their favourite songs

# Projects

## [🎸 Guitaraoke](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Guitaraoke)

### Overview

A standalone Python application, this software implements open-source pre-trained Machine Learning models
and audio libraries to provide a gamified environment for electric guitarists to learn to play new songs.

### Features

A practical and minimalist GUI with aesthetic CSS styling was built using PyQt5.

Guitar separation of a song is done through use of the 6-stem HT Demucs MSS model, while Spotify's Basic
Pitch library is implemented to predict note events in both the user's guitar input and the song's guitar
track.

A scoring algorithm compares predicted pitch information between the user and song's guitar to determine
a performance score and note accuracy rate that is displayed in real-time.

Gameplay modes include: a practice mode with audio playback controls to facilitate song learning,
and a playthrough mode that saves a user's final score to be displayed in the song library menu.

### Technologies Used

**Python • PyQt5 • NumPy • Pandas • Librosa**

## [🏃 Fitter](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Fitter)

### Overview

A web development project that showcased fullstack development skills, producing a prototype for a 
fitness-themed social media platform with Strava API integration and functionality for following users,
posting activities, liking, commenting, and more.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript • Node/Express • MySQL • HTML • CSS**

## [🎵 Karaoke and Rhythm Game](https://github.com/sahas036211/p5-Karaoke-and-Rhythm-Game)

### Overview

A proof of concept built using the p5.js library that features a keyboard-controlled
rhythm game, a karaoke game using microphone input, and a music player providing
audio playback controls and various visualisers to select from.

### Features

The rhythm game features procedural real-time note generation synchronised to the song's tempo,
an in-depth scoring system, difficulty options that adjust note spawn rates, and 3D graphics
rendering of game environment.

The music player showcases various visualisations, audio playback controls, a clickable progress
bar, and a webcam input integrated visualisation through use of p5's FFT functions.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript • p5.js**

## [🧑‍🏫 Bookit: Room Booking Application](https://github.com/jbrun001/roombooking)

### Overview

A collaborative group project to develop a responsive room booking web application for a university.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript • Node/Express • MySQL • HTML • CSS**

## [🇭 Hangman Game](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Java-Hangman-Game)

### Overview 

An endless hangman game with a simple score system designed as a small test application to demonstrate 
proficiency with Java Swing. 

### Technologies Used

**Java**
