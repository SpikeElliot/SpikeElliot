help users learn to play their favourite songs

# Projects

## [🎸 Guitaraoke](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Guitaraoke)

### Overview

A standalone Python application, this software implements open-source pre-trained Machine Learning models
and audio libraries to provide a gamified environment for electric guitarists to learn to play new songs.

### Features and Implementation

A practical and minimalist GUI with CSS styling was built in PyQt5.

Guitar separation of a song is done through use of the HT Demucs 6S model, while Spotify's Basic Pitch
library is implemented to predict note events in both the user's guitar input and the song's guitar track.

A scoring algorithm compares predicted pitch information between the user and song's guitar to determine
a performance score and note accuracy rate that is displayed in real-time.

Gameplay modes include: a practice mode with audio playback controls to facilitate song learning,
and a playthrough mode that saves a user's final score to be displayed in the song library menu.

### Technologies Used

**Python, PyQt5, NumPy, Pandas, Librosa**

## [🏃 Fitter](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Fitter)

### Overview

A fullstack web development project to produce a prototype fitness-based social media platform on
which users can share their Strava activities, like, comment, and more.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node/Express, MySQL**

## [🎵 Karaoke and Rhythm Game](https://github.com/sahas036211/p5-Karaoke-and-Rhythm-Game)

### Overview

A proof of concept built using the p5.js library that features a keyboard-controlled
rhythm game, a karaoke game using microphone input, and a music player providing
audio playback controls and various visualisers to select from.

### Features

The rhythm game features procedural real-time note generation synchronised to the song's tempo,
an in-depth scoring system, difficulty options that adjust note spawn rates, and 3D graphics
rendering of game environment.

The music player showcases various visualisations, audio playback controls, a clickable progress
bar, and a webcam input integrated visualisation through use of p5's FFT functions.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript, p5**

## [🇭 Hangman Game](https://github.com/SpikeElliot/Java-Hangman-Game)

### Overview 

An endless hangman game designed as a small test application to demonstrate proficiency with Java Swing. 

### Technologies Used

**Java**

## [🧑‍🏫 Bookit: Room Booking Application](https://github.com/jbrun001/roombooking)

### Overview

A collaborative group project to develop a responsive room booking web application for a university.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node/Express, MySQL**
