### Overview

A standalone gamified guitar practice application for Windows: built in Python and incorporating
pre-trained machine learning models for MSS and AMT, a GUI framework, and libraries for audio streaming and data processing.

### Features

- Select any local audio file to perform, initiating guitar separation through use of the [6-stem HT Demucs MSS model](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs),
followed by pitch and onset detection of the song's separated guitar track using [Spotify's Basic Pitch library](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch).

- A scoring algorithm compares the user input and guitar tracks' predicted note events during playback
to display a real-time note accuracy rate, performance score, and swing display (indicating rushing or dragging).

- A responsive, easy-to-use GUI with aesthetic minimalist CSS styling was built with the PyQt6 framework.

- Using separate processes with Python's concurrent.futures module allows the application to handle audio playback manipulation,
real-time scoring in an audio recording and processing loop, and updating the GUI concurrently with no blocking or freezing.

- The practice mode provides helpful playback controls such as: a guitar track volume slider,
a play/pause button, a custom-made interactive waveform and playhead that allows seeking,
section looping with user-set markers, and more.

### Overview

A web development project showcasing full-stack development skills: produced a prototype for a 
fitness-themed social media platform with Strava API integration and functionality for posting activities,
following users, liking, commenting, and more.

### Features

- Integration with Strava API allows a user to connect their Fitter and Strava accounts through OAuth 2.0,
providing access to their recent activities. An activity can optionally be linked to any post, "embedding"
relevant exercise data in the post's body, allowing a user to easily share their performance with others.

- CSS styling creates a consistent aesthetic and intuitive user experience for the web app: a sidebar
provides easy navigation to important pages such as the user's profile, their likes, and the home page;
a sticky header displays a search bar and a dropdown menu of helpful quick actions.

- SQL queries in the Express middleware call Stored Procedures that are performed internally by the database.
This gives better efficiency, as operations are faster, and readability, as queries don‚Äôt need to be chained in the
middleware.

- Security and data integrity: All forms are validated and sanitised using express-validator to prevent
XSS attacks, all SQL queries are parameterised to avoid injection attacks, users' passwords are encrypted
and hash salted with bcrypt.

### Technologies Used

**JavaScript ‚Ä¢ Node/Express ‚Ä¢ MySQL ‚Ä¢ HTML ‚Ä¢ CSS**

</a>

### Overview

A proof-of-concept app built with the p5.js library: features a keyboard-controlled
rhythm game, a karaoke game using microphone input, and a music player with playback
controls and visualisers thanks to p5's FFT functions.

### Features

- The rhythm game features procedural real-time note generation synchronised to the song's tempo,
an in-depth scoring system, difficulty options that adjust note spawn rates, and 3D graphics
rendering of game environment.

- The karaoke game implements a pre-trained machine learning model for pitch detection; it provides
a pitch accuracy-based scoring system, timed lyrics display, and a fun webcam mode.

- The music player provides various animated visuals to choose from as well as:
multiple audio playback controls (play/pause, skip, song speed, etc.), a clickable song progress bar,
and a volume bar.
